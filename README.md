# Welcome to the **Online Store Tech Test** repository

![Online Store Tech Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcin-piekarski/online-store-tech-test/main/images/online-store-tech-test--preview.png 'Online Store Tech Test')

This repository contains a design of a _fake_ online store for the purposes of a technical test.

## Objective

We need you to use **key dependencies** listed below to build a server-side rendered online store using the [Figma](<[https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=x0nGLpgXwBZtJ90B-1)>)
design as a reference.

## Key Dependencies

- Use the provided [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1) design
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Either Pages or App Router
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) / [Fake Store API Docs](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) - Fake store rest API for your e-commerce or shopping website prototype
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/chevron-down)

## What we're looking for...

1. Fork of this Git repository containing a project which includes the above dependencies
2. Git commit messages which give us an idea of your workflow
3. Product listing page that displays products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) with each product card displaying an add to cart button
4. Dismissible overlay for the cart, checkout and order confirmation
5. Mock shipping/payment form in the checkout overlay with some basic validation
6. Product content that's server rendered

## What we're leaving up to you...

- It's up to you on how simple/complex you'd like to make the project
- It's up to you whether you use either the Pages or App Router in Next.js
- Add whatever additional dependencies that you'd like (ie. styling, fetch, etc, etc)
- Use whatever project structure you're comfortable with
- Use typescript if you'd like

For bonus points, if time permits, we'd be over the moon to see:

- Docker
- A "Backend-for-Frontend" type API

## Getting Started

1. Fork this Git Repository
2. Setup your project using the above dependencies
3. Build your project using the provided design as a guide
4. Share your Git Repository when your ready

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the Online Store Tech Test at:
[https://online-store-tech-test-lyart.vercel.app/](https://online-store-tech-test-lyart.vercel.app/)

The demo showcases a fully functional e-commerce store with:

- Server-side rendered product listings
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process with form validation
- Order confirmation flow
- Responsive design following the Figma specifications
- GraphQL API implementation
- Containerized with Docker
